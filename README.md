The concept app was first made in Keynote, then rebuilt in Xcode.

## Features
iEmirati has a few features. that may be small, yet very interesting.
The features included are:
- Word of the Day (teaches you an arabic word and when to use it)
- Explore Locations (a list of locations to visit, with Apple Maps and Google Maps support!)
- Quests (each location has quests)
- Recipes (will be added soon enough)

***QUESTS ARE UNABLE TO SAVE, WILL BE FIXED LATER SINCE THIS IS A PREVIEW***
