## What is it?
iEmirati is actually a project made for the <a href="https://iosdesign.ae/">iOS Design Challenge.

The concept app was first made in Keynote, then rebuilt in Xcode.

## Features
iEmirati has a few features that may be small, yet very interesting.
The features included are:
- Word of the Day (teaches you an arabic word and when to use it)
- Explore Locations (a list of locations to visit, with Apple Maps and Google Maps support!)
- Quests (each location has quests)
- Foods to try (it's in the name)

***QUESTS ARE UNABLE TO SAVE, WILL BE FIXED LATER SINCE THIS IS A PREVIEW***

## How to Build
To build iEmirati on your iOS device, all you need is a Mac and Xcode.

**You'll need to link your GitHub account to Xcode first.**

After linking your account, open this page on your Mac while logged in to your GitHub account. Click on the green **Code** button. You will see a button that says **Open in Xcode**. Click on that.

This will take you to Xcode. It will ask you to clone the project. Click **Clone**.

Or you could just open Xcode, click **Clone Git Repository**, then paste the link to the repo in the search bar, then click **Clone**.

After cloning, open the Xcode project. Once you're there, click the folder icon on your top right, then click the icon-shaped icon with the text **iEmirati**.

That will take you to the app's configuration settings. Click on **Signing and Capabilities**. Change the team to your team, if you already have one. If you don't, create a team.

The Bundle Identifier is naturally com.tyandco.iEmirati, there, you replace **tyandco** with your name.

After that, look at the top bar in the middle. See the app icon? Now look on the right. You'll see a random device simulator, which is probably the latest iPhone.

Connect your iOS device to your Mac, tap **Trust**, then on Xcode, you might see your device's name in the bar. If you don't, click on the device name, you'll find a list of devices. Click on your device, then click the **Build and Run** button. It looks like a Play button.
Your Mac will need to collect cached symbols from your device (necessary for building the app), it will take some time, so be patient.

Once it's done collecting the cached symbols, it will build the app on your device. Let's just pretend you have **Developer Mode** turned on. 

You will have to trust the app developer (in this case, your team). Press OK on the dialog box. Go to **Settings > General > VPN & Device Management**. You'll find your email for your Developer Apple ID. Tap on it, then tap **Trust**. Then open the app, and enjoy!
